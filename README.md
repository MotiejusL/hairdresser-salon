## Hairdresser salon website
A demonstrative website for a hairdresser salon that has two seperate pages for hairdressers and clients. 
It was created for learning purposes for DOM manipulation using javascript, so almost all the elements are created with it. 
I used LocalStorage to create a backend in the browser as an experiment and used webpack to help me bundle all of the javascript modules.

### Hairdressers page features
- View all the registered clients
- Add a new client to a list
- Filter all the registrations(by current day, tomorrows day and by selected date)
- Sort all the registrations by date

### Clients page features
